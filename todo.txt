To Do List
-------------------------

>>> SPECIALS & COUPONS <<<
- how to do specials? Should it be a seperate module? [CHALLENGE]
		- Case 1: Simple discount, 50% off select combos
		- Case 2: Multiple Items Special, 2 drinks and 2 medium pizzas
		- Case 3: Free addon with coupon code
- should the coupons on Promo.html link to a list of valid_foods that the coupon applies to? [EASY]
- how should coupons be limited? eg. max 1 coupon per item, max 1 coupon per order...etc? [LOGICAL PLANNING]
- foodCtrl.js when removing the coupon popup (ng-hide), all addons are removed from the array instead of only drinks or only sides. Same with used_coupons array [MEDIUM]
- For PROMOS with multiple main_foods (eg. 2 large pizzas for $12.99), the toppings that get applied to one will get applied to all. Perhaps use .splice()? Also, there should be a validation where user must select toppings for ALL main_foods before being able to proceed to checkout. [MEDIUM]
- For PROMOS, how to calculate the total amount and show a receipt? [MEDIUM]
- what about coupons for $1 drinks instead of $1 off drinks? [MEDIUM]



>>> DELIVERY & BACKEND <<<
- integration of Google Maps address auto-complete API [EASY w/effort]
- storage of transaction receipts [EASY]
- transfer of database onto backend [MEDIUM w/effort]




>>> TOPPINGS <<<
- dealing with max free toppings vs paid toppings [EASY]
- allow for additional toppings at extra cost ...note that additional sides and drinks should be ordered seperately [MEDIUM] 
- What if you buy a solo food item and it comes with 1 free dipping sauce? Dipping sauce is organized as a side dish, but if combo==false, then user cannot choose which dip! [MEDIUM]





>>> SIZES OF FOODS <<<
- sizes of drinks/sides...aka upgrades. Basic upgrades are implemented, but no limits on how many. See food_detail.html for more details [MEDIUM]




>>> VISUAL FRONT END <<<
- selecting a promo food will show an image of the food. However, if no food is yet selected, the image will will be an ugly blank. find a placeholder image. [EASY]
- cart.html does not show addons for each food item. ng-repeat does not work [FIX ERROR]
