To Do List
-------------------------

- how to do specials? Should it be a seperate module? [CHALLENGE]
		- Case 1: Simple discount, 50% off select combos
		- Case 2: Multiple Items Special, 2 drinks and 2 medium pizzas
		- Case 3: Free addon with coupon code

- integration of Google Maps address auto-complete API [EASY w/effort]

- storage of transaction receipts [EASY]

- dealing with max free toppings vs paid toppings [EASY]

- transfer of database onto backend [MEDIUM w/effort]

- differntiate between solo food price and combo food price [EASY]

- allow for additional toppings at extra cost ...note that additional sides and drinks should be ordered seperately [MEDIUM] 

- cart.html does not show addons for each food item. ng-repeat does not work [FIX ERROR]

- foodCtrl.js when removing the coupon popup (ng-hide), all addons are removed from the array instead of only drinks or only sides. Same with used_coupons array [MEDIUM]

- should the coupons on Promo.html link to a list of valid_foods that the coupon applies to? [EASY]
