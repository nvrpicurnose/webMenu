To Do List
-------------------------

- how to do specials? Should it be a seperate module? [CHALLENGE]
		- Case 1: Simple discount, 50% off select combos
		- Case 2: Multiple Items Special, 2 drinks and 2 medium pizzas
		- Case 3: Free addon with coupon code
- should the coupons on Promo.html link to a list of valid_foods that the coupon applies to? [EASY]
- how should coupons be limited? eg. max 1 coupon per item, max 1 coupon per order...etc?


- integration of Google Maps address auto-complete API [EASY w/effort]
- storage of transaction receipts [EASY]
- transfer of database onto backend [MEDIUM w/effort]


- dealing with max free toppings vs paid toppings [EASY]
- allow for additional toppings at extra cost ...note that additional sides and drinks should be ordered seperately [MEDIUM] 
- What if you buy a solo food item and it comes with 1 free dipping sauce? Dipping sauce is organized as a side dish, but if combo==false, then user cannot choose which dip! [MEDIUM]


- cart.html does not show addons for each food item. ng-repeat does not work [FIX ERROR]
- foodCtrl.js when removing the coupon popup (ng-hide), all addons are removed from the array instead of only drinks or only sides. Same with used_coupons array [MEDIUM]



- sizes of drinks/sides...aka upgrades. Basic upgrades are implemented, but no limits on how many. See food_detail.html for more details [MEDIUM]
- when clearing the coupons, the price is reverted back to the original $scope.food.price or $scope.promo.price instead of the selected size's price [MEDIUM]
