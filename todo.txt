To Do List
-------------------------
>>> BASIC FRONT END SELLABLE MODEL <<<
- Make a front end that is nice enough to show off
- Use an example resturant


>>> SPECIALS & COUPONS <<<
- should the coupons on Promo.html link to a list of valid_foods that the coupon applies to? [EASY]
- how should coupons be limited? eg. max 1 coupon per item, max 1 coupon per order...etc? [LOGICAL PLANNING]
- For PROMOS, how to calculate the total amount and show a receipt? [MEDIUM]
- what about coupons for $1 drinks instead of $1 off drinks? [MEDIUM]
- foodCtrl.js when removing the coupon popup (ng-hide), all addons are removed from the array instead of only drinks or only sides. Same with used_coupons array [MEDIUM]



>>> DELIVERY & BACKEND <<<
- integration of Google Maps address auto-complete API [EASY w/effort]
- storage of transaction receipts [EASY]
- transfer of database onto backend [MEDIUM w/effort]




>>> TOPPINGS <<<
- dealing with max free toppings vs paid toppings [EASY]
- allow for additional toppings at extra cost ...note that additional sides and drinks should be ordered seperately [MEDIUM] 
- What if you buy a solo food item and it comes with 1 free dipping sauce? Dipping sauce is organized as a side dish, but if combo==false, then user cannot choose which dip! [MEDIUM]




>>> SIZES OF FOODS <<<
- sizes of drinks/sides...aka upgrades. Basic upgrades are implemented, but no limits on how many. See food_detail.html for more details [MEDIUM]




>>> VISUAL FRONT END <<<
- selecting a promo food will show an image of the food. However, if no food is yet selected, the image will will be an ugly blank. find a placeholder image. [EASY]
- cart.html does not show addons for each food item. ng-repeat does not work [FIX ERROR]
- the page that lets you choose your promos should be incremental, which means it should show a whole page for the toppings of each pizza and then a whole page for drinks...etc until the last page to review & confirm. This also acts as validation that the toppings for all mains are added. [MEDIUM]
